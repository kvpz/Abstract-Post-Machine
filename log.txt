Project 2 log

-Working on Load function.
-Implemented all its output cases (successful opening of file with or without
batch mode and loop if .pp file doesn't exist)

5/31/15
-After file is typed in, "Input string (To end *):" prints twice on same line.
ch = std::cin.ignore() must be processing. Issue was resolved be clearing the
-Load () functions works properly. Checked by outputting what I stored in List.
-Attempting to get rid of all lines starting with '*' and the subset of
the line beginning with '*'(not sure if that is necessary). Only the PM program
and
final '*' are left. Current issue: One of subsets isn't being deleted entirely.
-Above problem fixed. All comments are removed in Load () and read into List
object.

Working on Run()
-VT102 Error after "Input string (To end *): VT102VT102VT102." Supposedly a
Failure
to open terminal for input (unix.com).
-Testing hello_world.pp. String accepted only if '1' is input.
-Front() is being called on an empty deque. Fixed with an if statement.
-Tape content at rejection is printing all past rejections too.
  Now it prints #&Hello World!Hello World! in every string rejected case
    even without a successful string accepted before hand, along with incorrect
      string in front of it. I does not print anything after string rejected
        when 12/123.
	-Tape is clearing fine.
	-Biggest issue may be coming from for loop processing instructions
	-Hello world now prints for 1, 12, 123, but prints infinite hello worlds
	after
	  an incorrect string. Match = 1 was in wrong place.
	  -Strings are being rejected appropriately, but Tape contents at
	  rejection is still
	  printing 2 hello world! and 4 when it is any of the valid input
	  sequences (it is
	  print after '#').
	  -program works. I had to move around much of what I had originally
	  plus throw in
	  some conditionals(if and while statements). Currently modifying for
	  software engineering considerations.
- program didn't run for batch test. The problem was that I was not
clearing program_.
